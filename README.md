# Task 1
* Develop a "vector" class for working with three-dimensional vectors.
* Overload operations for the class that are allowed for working with three-dimensional vectors.
* Create unit tests to test the developed methods.
# Task 2
* Develop a "polynomial" class for working with polynomials from a single variable.
* Overload operations for the class that are allowed for working with polynomials.
* Create unit tests to test the developed methods.
# Task 3
* Develop a class hierarchy for storing information about the store's products(type, name, price).
* Provide for the operation of adding two identical products - in this case, the name is formed as a concatenation of the two names, separated by the dash symbol, and the cost is the average cost of the two products.
* Provide for the possibility of bringing one type to another.
* Provide for the possibility of converting the product type to an integer (the price is returned in kopecks) and a real type.
* Create unit tests to test the developed methods.
